For the designated amount of time after a message is read from a queue, it will not be visible to any other reader. As long as the amount of time that it takes to process the message is less than the visibility timeout, every message will be processed and deleted. In the event that the component processing the message fails or becomes unavailable, the message will again become visible to any component reading the queue once the visibility timeout ends. This allows you to have many components all reading messages from the same queue, with each working to process different messages. https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/faqs/ ",

A local secondary index is \"local\" in the sense that every partition of a local secondary index is scoped to a table partition that has the same hash key. Global secondary index is an index with a hash and range key that can be different from those on the table. A global secondary index is considered \"global\" because queries on the index can span all of the data in a table, across all partitions. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DataModel.html ",
