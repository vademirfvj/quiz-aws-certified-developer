The number of network interfaces and privateIP addresses that a user can specify for an instance depends on the instance type. This scenario helpswhen the user wants to host multiple websites on a single EC2 instance. After the user has assigned asecondary private IP address to his instance, he needs to configure the operating system on thatinstance to recognize the secondary private IP address.For AWS Linux, the ec2-net-utils package can take care of this step. It configures additional networkinterfaces that the user can attach while the instance is running, refreshes secondary IP addressesduring DHCP lease renewal, and updates the related routing rules.http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/MultipleIP.html",
